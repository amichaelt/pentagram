		<sub name="obtain_u8">
			<header>Where can I obtain a copy of Ultima 8?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					If you do not already own a legal copy
					of Ultima 8, the <Pent/> team highly
					suggests you buy a copy. We suggest
					searching for Ultima 8 on sites such as
					Ebay or used software sites. Stores
					which sale used games are often are
					good places to try as well.
				</para>
				<para>
					You also might want to look for the
					Ultima Collection, which contain all
					the previous Ultima games as well.
				</para>

		<sub name="filthy_pirate">
			<header>Can you give me a copy or tell me where to
				download Ultima 8?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					No! The <Pent/> team does not and never
					will support piracy.
				</para>
				<para>
					Members of the <Pent/> team will likely
					ignore, flame, or even banish you
					to another world where no one has ever
					heard of the Avatar if you ask them for
					a pirated copy of any Ultima.
				</para>
			</body>
		</sub>
		<sub name="poor_justification">
			<header>But isn't Ultima 8 abandonware?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					No, if a entity still exists to claim
					the rights over a piece of software (EA
					in the case of Ultima 8), and the
					company has not openly given away those
					right to make the software free, then
					the software does not fall under the
					term abandonware or freeware.
				</para>
				<para>
					Any copies of Ultima 8 you find on the
					Internet that claim to be abandoned or
					free are neither, and downloading them
					will be considered piracy.
				</para>
			</body>
		</sub>
		<sub name="against_piracy">
			<header>Why does the <Pent/> team feel so strongly on
				the issue of piracy?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					First, we understand the amount of work
					that goes into making a game like
					Ultima 8. If we put ourselves into the
					same position as the original
					programmers and artists, we would be
					against the piracy of our work and feel
					that something has be stolen from us
					directly when piracy occurs.
				</para>
				<para>
					Second, the <Pent/> team does not want
					to alienate any former or current
					members of Origin or EA. Some have been
					helpful in the past in informing us,
					and we have a great deal of respect for
					them. We also wish to avoid any
					possible legal issues which could
					threaten to end the <Pent/> project.
