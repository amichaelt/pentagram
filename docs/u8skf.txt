Info about the U8 skf files
---------------------------

The SKF files are used for the intro and endgame sequences.

They are just a simple flex containing a series of 'frames' that the flic
player interpretes to do various things.

I believe that Index 0 in the flex is what can be described as the play list.
It contains what to play, and when to play it.

It consists of 6 byte blocks, divided into 3 int16s, terminated by a
FFFF FFFF FFFF block.
The first int16 is the shape to display, the second int16 the type of
action (see list below), and the third int16 a parameter to the action.

Type 0x03 : Play Music. Data is num in music.flx
Type 0x04 : Slow stop music
Type 0x05 : Play SFX. Data is num in sound.flx
Type 0x06 : Stop SFX.
Type 0x07 : Set Speed (FPS????)
Type 0x08 : Fade to black
Type 0x09 : Fade to palette (Data is palette index in skf)
Type 0x0C : Wait
Type 0x0E : Play sound (Data is index in the skf)
Type 0x12 : Clear subtitles???

The rest of the indices contain the actual frames. There are various types of
data.

The first 2 bytes desribe what type of data.

Here is what I know:

Type 0x00 : Nothing

Type 0x01 : Palette

Type 0x02 : Shape
Same format as a normal shape. However the full size normal header is missing.
The shape is just a single frame. The header in the shapes starts of from the
shapeframe header compression word.
Header {
	uint16	compression;
	uint16	width;
	uint16	height;
	uint16	xoff;
	uint16	yoff;
};

Type 0x0D : Signed 8 Bit Sound
Header {
	uint32	size;
	uint16	samplerate;
	uint16	channels;
	uint8	unused[24];
};
Signed 8bit data follows

Type 0x11 : Subtitle
