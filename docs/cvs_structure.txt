Just a quick overview of all the important subdirectories. Most of them will be
currently unimplemented, until at least someone actually writes code for them,
or transfers it from the 'old' cvs module. *grin*

audio/     -- Pretty obviously for audio related classes and code

convert/  -- The conversion related classes, used for converting the
shapes, usecode, etc from their game dependant formats, to our game
independant formats, hopefully. *grin*

filesys/  -- The pentagram FileSystem related classes (file wrappers,
buffers, etc.

graphics/ -- IIRC, it's everything to do with shapes/gumps/maps and the
rendering of such.

gumps/     -- For all the gump related classes. In my vision, gumps will
almost be like our own windowing system.

input/     -- For the input handling classes (maybe). This just depends on
how we actually handle input. Ideally I think the should only be a single
event handling function in the engine which then dispatches the input to
the component that currently has focus. Another dir for this may not be
needed.

kernel/   -- Here goes the Kernel and it's associated classes, including
the UsecodeMachine.

mainmenu/  -- Darke's funky main menu system. If it's implemented with
gumps, it should probably go under gumps instead.

savegame/  -- For the files related to savegame handling. The name of this
dir possibly should not be called 'savegame' as that was the name of the
original Ultima8's savegame dir. A better name is required, but it's
obvious the purpose of the dir.

utils/    -- (misc/ maybe?) Just the random header and utility files.
Like the [su]int[8|16|32] defines.

world/     -- For world and object managing code. Probably would contain
the physics code too. The code to resolve an item number into a world
object would be here somewhere (as part of the object manager).

With the addition:

tools/     -- Inside this there's a subdirectory for each tool, and the 
relevant source goes into that directory. For 
compilers/disassemblers/decompilers/viewers/commandline converters/etc.
