Update by Colourless Dragon 8th April 2002

The sounds are indeed compressed with Sonarc. dcmpsound (included with 
pentagram) can be used to decompress the sounds. This is done by calling the
DCMP8 function within U8.EXE and getting it to decompress the sounds for us.

In U8.exe there is some mention of sonarc.c and therefore it seems that the
sfx was compressed using a shareware tool named sonarc
(http://www.firstpr.com.au/audiocomp/lossless/sonarc/). But unfortunately
it seems Origin used a modified version to the shareware one. The author of
the sfx is not availlable anymore (email address doesn't exist anymore and
Google doesn't find him in any other way) and therefore there is no way to
decompress the sfx for now (and play them any other way than through the
game).

Josef Drexler aka Aquamarine Dragon helped me to figure this out.
Unfortunately he reached a dead end:

"... a better person [than the sonarc developer] to talk to would be someone
who worked on U8 as opposed to the sonarc person.  Anyway, I didn't find out
anything useful, I tried to do some reverse engineering but because of U8's
weird memory management I didn't get anywhere.  Sorry, but unless someone has
a brilliant idea I don't think this is going anywhere (though I suppose it
couldn't hurt to ask in rgcud if anyone know sonarc, or maybe
comp.compression too.)"
