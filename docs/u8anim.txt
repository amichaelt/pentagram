U8's anim.dat:
------------------

anim.dat contains common animation sequences for actors.

at offset 0 is a lookup table containing 2048 4-byte (absolute) offsets into 
anim.dat (one for each shape). Offset is zero if the shape is no actor.

These shape offsets point at more lookup tables. Each of these tables
consists of 64 4-byte (absolute) offsets. These point to the actual
frame sequences. The 64 sequences are specific 'actions'. They're listed below.

Frame sequences have the following format:
4 byte header: byte 0 is length of sequences. rest unknown
header is followed by 8 * length 6-byte frame entries: 
(8 = number of directions, in the order N NE E SE S SW W NW) 

byte 0 + lowest 3 bits of byte 1: frame number
byte 1, bit 3: footstep?
	bit 4: unknown (only used for troll,daemon,skeleton,eyebeast, act.14)
	bit 5-7: unused
byte 2: change in Z coordinate
byte 3: SFX# to play (zero for none?)
byte 4: movement in 'main' direction. (* 4 units)
byte 5:	bit 0: unknown (only used when moving backwards?)
	bit 1: interruptable?
	bit 2: unknown
	bit 3: unknown
	bit 4: unknown (only in action 7 for mages. spell trigger?)
	bit 5: flipped?
	bits 6-7: unused
