This is a text file that has 2 sections. It uses MSDOS line breaks


Section 1:

This Section lists the filenames of all the songs and includes some details
Format of the entries are as follows:

SONGNAME.XMI a b c

'a' seems to be the track number encoded as a char. If the songs are reordered
alphabetically, they match the order that they appear in the flex. It appears
this is the index in the flex for the GM version of the song.

'b' Unknown

'c' Unknown

Example:
tenebrae.xmi 8 51 1

The ASCII value for '8' is 0x38 as hex, or 56 as Dec. This maps to track 56.
