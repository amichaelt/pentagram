Basic file structure:
----------------------
eusecode.flx is a 'standard' U8 flex file
(I named the objects in the flex 0.u8o, 1.u8o, ..., 1432.u8o)

0.u8o contains global flag names. (the ones used by opcodes 4E/4F)
1.u8o contains usecode function names.

after that, 2+x.u8o corresponds to the usecode function for shape number x
(so, the code for shape 375 (the abacus) is in 377.u8o)

Also, 1026+x.u8o seems to correspond to NPC number x. (However, if this is
like in Ultima 7's usecode, this is not fixed)

Structure of those usecode function files:
---
4 bytes		unknown
4 bytes		filesize
4 bytes		unknown. Always seems to be a bit larger than filesize
32 x 4 bytes	32 'eventid' pointers. (relative to the start of this table)
rest		the actual usecode
---

an 'eventid pointer' ties a subroutine in the u8o to a specific event.
These events are:

ID      Function                Description
-------------------------------------------
 0	Item::look()		on single click 
 1	Item::use()		on double click
 2	Item::anim()		Animate() (see typeflag.txt to see when called)
 3	unused
 4	Item::cachein()		on load (functions 232 (MUSIC) and 402 (AVATAR))
 5	Item::hit(ushort,short)
 6	Item::gotHit(ushort,short) stepped on? (also when an object is placed on it?)
				could also be 'destroyed' (chair DE is turned into a
				broken chair 22A)
 7	Egg::hatch()
 8	Npc::schedule()		AdvanceSchedule() (called when???) - Note avatar has it too, but there
				it is used to control the stroms.
 9	Item::release()		stepped from? (also when object is removed?)
 A	unused
 B	unused
 C	Item::combine()		quantity changed? (only for function 8F (COINS))
 D	unused
 E	unused
 F	Item::enterFastArea()	ProximityClose (was off screen, now on???) 
10	Item::leaveFastArea()	ProximityFar (was on screen, now off???)
11	Item::cast(ushort)	attacked?
12	Item::justMoved()	(only for function 401 (AVATAR))
13	Item::AvatarStoleSomething(ushort)
14	unused
15	Item::guardianBark(int) 
16	unused
17	unused
18	unused
19	unused
1A	unused
1B	unused
1C	unused
1D	unused
1E	unused
1F	unused

(one pointer is usually 0x80, meaning the code right after the table.
This is offset 0x8C from the start of the u8o)
