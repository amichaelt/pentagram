Items
--------

This should describe where/how items are stored, and how they need to be
handled.

This file was created to organize my thoughts on this (-wjp)



Items that are currently 'in use'
------------------------------------
This includes items in the current map, and 'permanent' items (NPCs and their
inventories)

All these items have an object ID assigned, and so they are retrievable by
World::getObject().

Items that are directly part of the map (this excludes items in containers
but includes NPCs on the current map) are stored in the CurrentMap class,
in a large array of per-chunk object lists. (CurrentMap::items[][])

They are no longer in their Map object at this point. 

Items that came from Map::fixeditems have the extended flag EXT_FIXED set.
NB: while it is allowed to make changes to EXT_FIXED items, such changes can
disappear on map-change. They will be saved in a savegame.

Items that are in CurrentMap, but are not originally from a Map object have
the EXT_NOTINMAP extended flag set.

Items in containers have a pointer (Item::parent) to their parent, and are
not directly part of CurrentMap. They also have the FLG_CONTAINED status flag
set.

QUESTION: which status do equipped items have? (Such as the avatar's backpack
and weapon/armour) Is their owner also their parent, or do they have a special
status?
Equipped items have the FLG_EQUIPPED flag set.


GlobEggs are expanded in CurrentMap, meaning that their contents are
treated as normal objects. The contents have the EXT_INGLOB extended flag
set. Contents of a glob egg are chained together by the Item::glob_next
and GlobEgg::contents fields.
NB: because of this, it is not allowed to delete an EXT_INGLOB item.
Modifying an EXT_INGLOB item is allowed, but as with EXT_FIXED items, changes
can disappear on map-change.







Items that are not in use
---------------------------
This includes the fixed/nonfixed items on all maps but the current map. 
The fixed items most likely will be swapped out, but the nonfixed items
have to be kept in memory.

They are stored in the various Map objects in World. (in Map::fixeditems and
Map::dynamicitems)

They do not have object IDs assigned.

The contents of GlobEggs are not stored here.
