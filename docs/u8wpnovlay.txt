U8's wpnovlay.dat:
-------------------

wpnovlay.dat is a flex file.
The objects in the flex correspond directly to animations.


Each object is divided into a number of blocks, where each block corresponds
to an 'overlay type' (mace, sword, axe, dagger).

Each block consists of 8 subblocks, each corresponding to a direction.

These subblocks contain 4-byte structures, one for each animation frame:

sint8 x-offset
sint8 y-offset
uint16 frame


The shape the frame is in, is hardcoded into u8.exe and depends only
on the overlay type:

overlay type	shape
0		0x00F1
1		0x00F3
2		0x00F4
3		0x00F5


The overlay type for each weapon is also hardcoded in u8.exe:

weapon shape	overlay type
0x01A1		0
0x01A2		3
0x01A3		2
0x01A4		1
0x021C		0
0x021D		1
0x021E		1
0x032F		0
0x0330		0
0x0331		1
0x0332		1
0x0333		1
0x0334		3
0x0335		1
0x0336		2
