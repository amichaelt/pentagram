Ancient Ones, second speech:

class 048B (ANCTONES) uses a mutex flag 'startedConvo' [0000 01] to
(try to) make sure that only one conversation with the Ancient Ones is started.
This is necessary because there are two eggs which trigger this conversation
to cover the entire area.

However, for the second speech, this flag is only set _after_ waiting for a
Camera::scrollTo to finish, which gives a second process enough time to
pass the !startedConvo check.

FIX:
Set startedConvo flag to 1 at offset 0949 instead of at 09A5.

WORKAROUND:
Serious hack in UCMachine which sets startedConvo to true as soon as
setAvatarInStasis is called. This makes sure the flag is set at the right time.



Ethereal spell Monster Summoning:

class 0585 (ETHRSPEL) doesn't set FAST_ONLY on the summoned monster. This
means that Item::callUsecodeEvent erroneously thinks the monster is a full
NPC with its own usecode and calls usecode function 1024+ObjId instead of
the usecode belonging to the monster's shape/type.

Confirmed with the original: summoning a monster and then clicking on it
does not produce the monster's name. Setting the FAST_ONLY flag (0x0080)
in the savegame manually makes the monster's name appear.

There are more cases of usecode calling Npc::create() without setting
the FAST_ONLY flag. Need to investigate this further.

FIX:
Unknown

WORKAROUND:
Added a new extended item flag EXT_PERMANENT_NPC which is set on all
NPCs with a fixed ObjId (i.e., those loaded in World::loadItemCachNPCData).
This is used to determine if an item's usecode class is (1024+ObjId).
To improve compatibility with the original, callUsecodeEvent doesn't call any
usecode when EXT_PERMANENT_NPC and FLG_FAST_ONLY are both unset.



Mythran conversation global size:

The global 0x0129 ('paganLore') has a size of 1 bit. At MYTHRAN::5B3B it is
set to 0x2, which doesn't fit.

FIX:
unknown

WORKAROUND:
unknown
