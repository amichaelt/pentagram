Ancient Ones, second speech:

class 048B (ANCTONES) uses a mutex flag 'startedConvo' [0000 01] to
(try to) make sure that only one conversation with the Ancient Ones is started.
This is necessary because there are two eggs which trigger this conversation
to cover the entire area.

However, for the second speech, this flag is only set _after_ waiting for a
Camera::scrollTo to finish, which gives a second process enough time to
pass the !startedConvo check.

WORKAROUND:
Serious hack in UCMachine which sets startedConvo to true as soon as
setAvatarInStasis is called. This makes sure the flag is set at the right time.
