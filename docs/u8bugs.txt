USECODE BUGS:
--------------

Ancient Ones, second speech:

class 048B (ANCTONES) uses a mutex flag 'startedConvo' [0000 01] to
(try to) make sure that only one conversation with the Ancient Ones is started.
This is necessary because there are two eggs which trigger this conversation
to cover the entire area.

However, for the second speech, this flag is only set _after_ waiting for a
Camera::scrollTo to finish, which gives a second process enough time to
pass the !startedConvo check.

Note: this is fixed in the German and French CD versions of U8.

FIX:
Set startedConvo flag to 1 at offset 0949 instead of at 09A5.

WORKAROUND:
Serious hack in UCMachine which sets startedConvo to true as soon as
setAvatarInStasis is called. This makes sure the flag is set at the right time.



Ethereal spell Monster Summoning:

class 0585 (ETHRSPEL) doesn't set FAST_ONLY on the summoned monster. This
means that Item::callUsecodeEvent erroneously thinks the monster is a full
NPC with its own usecode and calls usecode function 1024+ObjId instead of
the usecode belonging to the monster's shape/type.

Confirmed with the original: summoning a monster and then clicking on it
does not produce the monster's name. Setting the FAST_ONLY flag (0x0080)
in the savegame manually makes the monster's name appear.

There are more cases of usecode calling Npc::create() without setting
the FAST_ONLY flag. Need to investigate this further.

FIX:
Unknown

WORKAROUND:
Added a new extended item flag EXT_PERMANENT_NPC which is set on all
NPCs with a fixed ObjId (i.e., those loaded in World::loadItemCachNPCData).
This is used to determine if an item's usecode class is (1024+ObjId).
To improve compatibility with the original, callUsecodeEvent doesn't call any
usecode when EXT_PERMANENT_NPC and FLG_FAST_ONLY are both unset.



Mythran conversation global size:

The global 0x0129 ('paganLore') has a size of 1 bit. At MYTHRAN::5B3B it is
set to 0x2, which doesn't fit.

FIX:
unknown

WORKAROUND:
unknown



Tenebrae gate guard initial conversation:

When you approach the Tenebrae gate guard for the first time while
he is in the middle of a turn, the turn will continue while the
guard is pathfinding towards you. The reason is that the 'Halt, stranger'
process only kills the patrol process, and leaves its child turn process.

FIX:
Kill the turn process as well when killing the patrol process?

WORKAROUND:
unknown



[German 2.12] Wrong sorcery candle placement not properly detected:

Pentagram can crash when the sorcery candles are places incorrectly.
This is a bug in the German 2.12 usecode, where it uses the strings
" Irgendetwas stimmt nicht!" and " Irgendetwas stimmt nicht."
(note the punctuation).

FIX:
Patch usecode to make the strings equal

WORKAROUND:
Serious hack in UCMachine changes the '!' to a '.' (only in the string
" Irgendetwas stimmt nicht!" in usecode class 0x7C).

MAP BUGS:
----------

Map 62: (Ancient Necromancers)

There are many missing ground/wall tiles in the region from
around (16555,6075,48) to the lava in the west, and around (19999,6758,48)

FIX:
Add the tiles listed below to the map in fixed.dat after checking
that this doesn't leave any holes.

WORKAROUND:
Adding tiles to the map manually in Map::loadFixed.
These seems to cover up the most easily reachable holes:
Ground at: (16255,6143,48), (16639,6143,48), (16511,6143,48),
           (15999,6015,48), (15871,6015,48), (15743,6015,48), (15615,6015,48),
           (15999,6143,48), (15871,6143,48), (15743,6143,48), (15615,6143,48),
           (20095,6911,48), (20223,6911,48), (20095,6783,48), (20223,6783,48),
           (19839,6655,48), (19967,6655,48), (19839,6527,48), (19967,6527,48),

Walls at: (15487, 6271, 48), (15359, 6271, 48)
Lava at: (14975, 6399, 0), (14975, 6015, 0),(15103, 6015, 0) 
(Ground: shape 301/1, Wall: shape 497/0, Lava: shape 409/32)



Map 25: (Lava river, after Carthax lake)

Missing ground/wall tiles around the entire southern wall, e.g.,
(21920,29736,8).

WORKAROUND:
None yet.



MISC BUGS:
-----------

Items 459 to 464 are "moss curtains" used extensively in the catacombs.
Some, but not all, include the SI_SOLID flag.  This makes some bodies in
some alcoves inaccessible.  Described in Pentagram bug tracker ID 1640075.

FIX:
None yet - would require patching the data files directly somehow, similar
to what is done for map bugs.

WORKAROUND:
Clear the SI_SOLID flag for shapes 459 to 464 in TypeFlags::load (U8 only)
