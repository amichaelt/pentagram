New Features and Enchancements Ideas for Pentagram
==================================================
Items found in this file can be either feature requests or just ideas that
might be cool to add to Pentagram. Any idea you have, no matter how strange,
should be added to this list. Who knows, maybe it would end up being really
cool.

Suggested style is to mark unimplemented features with a '-', vetoed features
with a '!', features currently being implemented with a 'o', and completed
features with a '+'

===============
- Keyboard movement - both relational and absolute as options
- Decay time on dead actors, like in Deus Ex
- Pathfinding Movement option for movement like diablo (would probably really
  help in testing the pathfinder too)
- A "Belt" - quick shortcut gump to items found in your backpack
- Food being more of a requirement in the game (hunger counter that damages if
  too high?)
- Custom menus - The book menu probably won't work well for all the options we
  might have
- Gimp Plugin
- Intro Screen? Maybe even a trailer intro if we get creative
- Graphic Scalers
- Layered Graphic Scalers (be able to scale gumps differently than the map)
- Joystick movement for Avatar or Cursor - gameplay option
- Force NPC's to spawn off screen and walk to the original spawn point.
