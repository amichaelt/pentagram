	* tools/disasm/Disasm.cpp : Autodetect gametype. Improved u8 function
	  name printing.

2002-10-26  Ryan Nunn <colourles@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Q_strcasecmp.* : Portable case insensitive compare from Quake 2
	* tools/disasm/Disasm.cpp : use Q_strcasecmp() instead of stricmp()

2002-10-26  Ryan Nunn <colourles@users.sourceforge.net>
	* misc/pent_include.* : File to the included at the top of every 
	  source file (this is not an option, it must be included). It will
	  include config.h. It will also include common_type.h and define some
	  useful things. It can double as a pre-compiled header for those
	  systems that support it.

	* misc/common_types.h : Removed some stuff and put them in
	  pent_include.h

	* misc/Args.cpp, filesys/FileSystem.cpp : Include pent_include.h

	* filesys/IDataSource.h: : Fixing a few virtual function issues

	* convert/Convert.h,  convert/crusader/ConvertUsecodeCrusader.h, 
	  convert/u8/ConvertUsecodeU8.h : Changes for TGWDS

	* tools/disasm/Disasm.cpp : Getting to compile in MSVC. Changes for
	  TGWDS. Added some loopscript stuff

2002-10-07  Ryan Nunn <colourles@users.sourceforge.net>
	* graphics/ : Pretty obvious what this is for, but don't expect
	  anything in there to work quite yet. Files are missing
	* graphics/Texture*.* : Some basic 32 bit Texture classes.
	* graphics/MD3_Model.* : Classes to load and use MD3 models.
	* ChangeLog : Changed my email address

2002-09-22  Darke  <darkepaw@users.sf.net>
	* convert/crusader/ConvertUsecodeCrusader.h, filesys/FileSystem.h,
	  tools/disasm/Disasm.cpp: Docs & code cleanup.

2002-09-22  Darke  <darkepaw@users.sf.net>
	* convert/*,tools/disasm/*: Moved more of the game specific usecode
	  handling to convert; Fixed up a couple of the opcode's docs.

2002-09-22  Darke  <darkepaw@users.sf.net>
	* misc/[Aa]rgs.*: Missed changing a header name.
	* filesys/*: All the file systems stuff. The primary FileSystem class
	  is rather bare and not completely correct, but good enough to use
	  it's basic features.
	* tools/disasm/*: Updated disasm to use the new DataSource classes.
	

2002-09-08  Darke  <darkepaw@users.sf.net>
	* tools/disasm/Disasm.cpp: All opcodes known, yay! Now we just have
	to figure out how they work. *grin*

2002-08-31  Darke  <darkepaw@users.sf.net>
	* various: filename changes from .cc to .cpp so that VisualC++ can wrap
	  it's poor little mind around them. *grin*

2002-08-26  Darke  <darkepaw@users.sf.net>
	* convert/, tools/disasm/, misc/args.*: type cleanup and abstraction.

2002-08-25  Darke  <darkepaw@users.sf.net>
	* *: Added the makefile system, a few docs, and the required files to
	  compile disasm.cc. Hopefully it works, although I expect it not to.
	  *grin*

2002-05-22  Ryan Nunn <colourles@users.sourceforge.net>
