When building pentagram, this directory should contain three frameworks:
SDL.framework from http://www.libsdl.org/
SDL_ttf.framework from http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/
libpng.framework from Pentagram website

The xcode project for Pentagram will copy these frameworks into the application
bundle before compiling sources
