1.1 What is Pentagram?

Pentagram is not Exult. Any similarities between Pentagram and Exult are 
purely coincidental.

1.2 Is it Exult for Ultima 8?

Of course not. As stated in 1.1, "Pentagram is not Exult". Anyway, what 
sort of fool would attempt such a thing anyway.

1.3 When will Pentagram be playable?

Well unless someone actually writes some code, never.

1.4 Does Pentagram support Crusader?

Crusader? What's that?

1.5 Will Pentagram be Multiplayer/Online

HELL NO!

1.6 What are TGWDS or TGYDS?

The Games We/You Don't Support.

1.7 But what _are_ TGWDS/TGYDS?

You don't need to know what they are, since we don't support them. QED.
