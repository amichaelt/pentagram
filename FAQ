1. Introduction
1.1. What is Pentagram?
Pentagram is not Exult. Any similarities between Pentagram and Exult are purely coincidental.


1.2. Is it Exult for Ultima 8?
Of course not. As stated in 1.1. "Pentagram is not Exult". Anyway, what sort of fool would attempt such a thing anyway.


1.3. When will Pentagram be playable?
Define 'playable'


1.4. Does Pentagram support Crusader?
Crusader? What's that?


1.5. Will Pentagram be Multiplayer/Online?
HELL NO!


1.6. What are TGWDS or TGYDS?
The Games We/You Don't Support.


1.7. But what _are_ TGWDS/TGYDS?
You don't need to know what they are, since we don't support them. QED.


1.8. Will we finish The Lost Vale?
See the answer to 1.5..


1.9. Why doesn't feature X work properly?
We prefer playing games to be a challenge.


1.10. Why isn't feature Y implemented?
It's better this way. Trust us.

2. Ultima 8: Pagan
2.1. Where can I obtain a copy of Ultima 8?
If you do not already own a legal copy of Ultima 8, the Pentagram team highly suggests you buy a copy. We suggest searching for Ultima 8 on sites such as ebay or used software sites. Stores which sale used games are often are good places to try as well.
You also might want to look for the Ultima Collection, which contain all the previous Ultima games as well.


2.2. Can you give me a copy or tell me where to download Ultima 8?
No! The Pentagram team does not and never will support piracy.
Members of the Pentagram team will likely ignore, flame, or even banish you to another world where no one has ever heard of the Avatar if you ask them for a pirated copy of any Ultima.


2.3. But isn't Ultima 8 abandonware?
No, if a entity still exists to claim the rights over a piece of software (EA in the case of Ultima 8), and the company has not openly given away those right to make the software free, then the software does not fall under the term abandonware or freeware.
Any copies of Ultima 8 you find on the internet that claim to be abandoned or free are neither, and downloading them will be considered piracy.


2.4. Why does the Pentagram team feel so strongly on the issue of piracy?
First, we understand the amount of work that goes into making a game like Ultima 8. If we put ourselves into the same position as the original programmers and artists, we would be against the piracy of our work and feel that something has be stolen from us directly when piracy occurs.
Second, the Pentagram team does not want to alienate any former or current members of Origin or EA. Some have been helpful in the past in informing us, and we have a great deal of respect for them. We also wish to avoid any possible legal issues which could threaten to end the Pentagram project.
