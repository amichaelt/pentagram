This repository contains code snippets and documents related to Origin's
Ultima 8:Pagan.


BUILDING FROM CVS
=================

Linux/Unix:

1) Run the "bootstrap" script to create the "configure" script
  ./bootstrap
2) Now run configure
  ./configure
3) Finally, start the build as usual
  make



Windows:
 ...


CONFIGURATION
=============

Pentagram needs a pentagram.cfg file to point it to the game data files.
In Linux, this has to be in a ~/.pentagram directory.
In Windows, it has to be in the current directory.

Pentagram also needs a u8bindings.cfg file to load the keybindings 
for Ultima 8. The default u8bindings.cfg is in the data directory.

A sample pentagram.cfg is included below:

<config>
 <games>
  <u8>
   <path>
    /path/to/u8
   </path>
   <work>
    /path/to/u8/work/dir
   </work>
  </u8>
 </games>
 <general>
  <data>
   /path/to/pentagram/data
  </data>
 </general>
 <video>
  <fullscreen>
   no
  </fullscreen>
  <width>
   640
  </width>
  <height>
   480
  </height>
 </video>
 <audio>
  <midi_driver>
  disabled/windows/fmopl/timidity/coreaudio
  </midi_driver>
 </audio>
</config>

Replace '/path/to/u8' with the directory containing 'u8.exe'.
Replace '/path/to/u8/work/dir' with the work directory (not used and
necessary yet - don't ask).
Replace '/path/to/pentagram/data' with the pentagram data directory (that's
the directory that contains fixedfont.tga).
Pick one of the midi drivers: disabled, windows, fmopl, timidity, coreaudio.
If you don't specify one, Pentagram will automatically select one, based on
your platform.
(Note: Windows will only work on Windows. CoreAudio only on MacOSX.)
(Note: for timidity you'll need a timidity patch set, and you may have
 to set the config/audio/timiditycfg entry to the full path of timidity.cfg.)

KEYBOARD COMMANDS
=================

These commands are likely to change in the future so keep an eye on CHANGELOG
as well.

Many of these can be changed in your u8bindings.cfg file.

~		: hides/restores console
page up/down	: scrolls console
arrow keys	: moves Avatar around the map (no walking yet)
home,end	: moves Avatar vertically
s		: toggles "avatarInStasis"
t		: outputs kernel/usecode/world/location stats to the console
e		: toggles editor items
h		: highlights any item you are "hitting", colliding with
c		: enables clipping
i		: open backpack
z		: open paperdoll/status
m		: switches combat mode on/off
ESC,q		: quits pentagram
[,]		: first ] clears the screen, multiple presses of ]
		  show the paint order. [ "steps" backward.
left mouse	: look at item/npc
right mouse	: use item/talk to npc
middle mouse	: feature test button :-) likely to change very often.
		  At the moment it is an object "hurler"
shift		: quarter speed mode. needs to be held down.
F7		: Quicksave (savegames get broken a lot, so don't rely on that)
F8		: Quickload


HACKS TO SHOW OFF
=================

f		: plays first scene (Avatar standing up, speaking to Devon)
g		: plays execution scene


SUPPORTED GAMES AND VERSIONS
============================

At the moment we only support the English version of Ultima 8 regardless of the
game version. Other languages might work but we can't be sure.

The games we don't support are defined in the FAQ.
