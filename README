This repository contains code snippets and documents related to Origin's
Ultima 8:Pagan.


BUILDING FROM CVS
=================

Linux/Unix:

1) Run the "bootstrap" script to create the "configure" script
  ./bootstrap
2) Now run configure
  ./configure
3) Finally, start the build as usual
  make



Windows:
 ...


CONFIGURATION
=============

Pentagram needs a pentagram.ini file to point it to the game data files.
In Linux, this has to be in a ~/.pentagram directory.
In Windows, it has to be in the current directory.

Pentagram also needs a u8bindings.ini file to load the keybindings
for Ultima 8. The default u8bindings.ini is already in the data directory.

A sample pentagram.ini is included below (this is all that is needed at the
moment to run Pentagram):

[pentagram]
data=path to pentagram data dir

[u8]
path=path to U8 directory


Replace 'path to pentagram data dir' with the pentagram data directory (that's
the directory that contains fixedfont.tga).
Replace 'path to pentagram data dir' with the directory containing 'u8.exe'.


ADVANCED CONFIGURATION
======================

Right now Pentagram assumes some default settings that don't need to be set to
make Pentagram work. If you want to change the music driver or the resoultion
Pentagram runs in, you see the defaults below:

[pentagram]
data=path to pentagram data dir
defaultgame=u8
fullscreen=no
width=640
height=480
bpp=32
midi_driver=disabled/windows/fmopl/timidity/coreaudio
timiditycfg=path to timidity.cfg

[u8]
path=path to U8 directory
save=path to U8 savegames directory


Replace 'path to pentagram data dir' with the pentagram data directory (that's
the directory that contains fixedfont.tga).
Replace 'path to pentagram data dir' with the directory containing 'u8.exe'.
Replace 'path to U8 savegames directory' with the directory you want Pentagram
to save games to (no, loading of the original's savegames is not supported).

Pick one of the midi drivers: disabled, windows, fmopl, timidity, coreaudio.
If you don't specify one, Pentagram will automatically select one, based on
your platform.
(Note: Windows will only work on Windows. CoreAudio only on MacOSX.)
(Note: for timidity you'll need a timidity patch set, and you may have
 to set the timiditycfg= entry to the full path of timidity.cfg.)

You may also override some settings under [pentagram] by writing them
under [u8]. The ones that can be oerriden are midi_driver, fullscreen,
width, height, bpp, timiditycfg.
Right now this is not necessary as we only support U8 but if we start to
support other games it might come in handy.


KEYBOARD COMMANDS
=================

These commands are likely to change in the future so keep an eye on CHANGELOG
as well.

Many of these can be changed in your u8bindings.cfg file.


left mouse	: look at item/NPC,
doubleclick left mouse: uses item/talks to NPC
right mouse	: walk/run (depending on distance between cursor and Avatar)
left mouse+right mouse	: jump or while running a running jump
middle mouse	: feature test button :-) likely to change very often.
		  At the moment it gives details on clicked objects.

~		: hides/restores console
page up/down	: scrolls console
arrow keys	: moves Avatar around the map (no walking yet)
home,end	: moves Avatar vertically
s		: toggles "avatarInStasis"
t		: outputs kernel/usecode/world/location stats to the console
e		: toggles editor items
h		: highlights any item you are "hitting", colliding with
c		: enables clipping
i		: open backpack
z		: open paperdoll/status
r		: recall
m		: switches combat mode on/off
x		: item locator
ESC,q	: quits pentagram
F7		: Quicksave (savegames get broken a lot, so don't rely on that)
F8		: Quickload
F12		: toggles frame by frame
[,]		: first ] clears the screen, multiple presses of ]
		  show the paint order. [ "steps" backward.
shift		: quarter speed mode. needs to be held down.


HACKS TO SHOW OFF
=================

f		: plays first scene (Avatar standing up, speaking to Devon)
g		: plays execution scene

If you copy VeraBd.ttf to the Pentagram data directory the font of U8
gets replaced by it.

SUPPORTED GAMES AND VERSIONS
============================

At the moment we only support the English version of Ultima 8 regardless of the
game version. Other languages might work but we can't be sure.

The games we don't support are defined in the FAQ.
