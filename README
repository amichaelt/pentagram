CONFIGURATION
=============

Pentagram needs a pentagram.cfg file to point it to the game data files.
In Linux, this has to be in a ~/.pentagram directory.
In Windows, it has to be in the current directory.

A sample pentagram.cfg is included below:

<config>
 <paths>
  <u8>
   /path/to/u8
  </u8>
  <data>
   /path/to/pentagram/data
  </data>
 </paths>
</config>

Replace '/path/to/u8' with the directory containing 'u8.exe'.
Replace '/path/to/pentagram/data' with the pentagram data directory (that's
the directory that contains fixedfont.tga).
