CONFIGURATION
=============

Pentagram needs a pentagram.cfg file to point it to the game data files.
In Linux, this has to be in a ~/.pentagram directory.
In Windows, it has to be in the current directory.

A sample pentagram.cfg is included below:

<config>
 <u8>
  <path>
   /path/to/u8
  </path>
  <work>
   /path/to/u8/work/dir
  </work>
 </u8>
 <general>
  <data>
   /path/to/pentagram/data
  </data>
 </general>
 <video>
  <fullscreen>
   no
  </fullscreen>
 </video>
</config>

Replace '/path/to/u8' with the directory containing 'u8.exe'.
Replace '/path/to/u8/work/dir' with the work directory (not used and
necessary yet - don't ask).
Replace '/path/to/pentagram/data' with the pentagram data directory (that's
the directory that contains fixedfont.tga).
