This repository contains code snippets and documents related to Origin's
Ultima 8:Pagan.


BUILDING FROM CVS
=================

Linux/Unix:

1) Run the "bootstrap" script to create the "configure" script
  ./bootstrap
2) Now run configure
  ./configure
3) Finally, start the build as usual
  make



Windows:
 ...


CONFIGURATION
=============

Pentagram needs a pentagram.cfg file to point it to the game data files.
In Linux, this has to be in a ~/.pentagram directory.
In Windows, it has to be in the current directory.

A sample pentagram.cfg is included below:

<config>
 <games>
  <u8>
   <path>
    /path/to/u8
   </path>
   <work>
    /path/to/u8/work/dir
   </work>
  </u8>
 </games>
 <general>
  <data>
   /path/to/pentagram/data
  </data>
 </general>
 <video>
  <fullscreen>
   no
  </fullscreen>
  <width>
   640
  </width>
  <height>
   480
  </height>
 </video>
</config>

Replace '/path/to/u8' with the directory containing 'u8.exe'.
Replace '/path/to/u8/work/dir' with the work directory (not used and
necessary yet - don't ask).
Replace '/path/to/pentagram/data' with the pentagram data directory (that's
the directory that contains fixedfont.tga).

e		: toggles editor items
h		: highlights any item you are "hitting", colliding with
c		: enables clipping
ESC,q		: quits pentagram
[,]		: first ] clears the screen, multiple presses of ]
		  show the paint order. [ "steps" backward.
left mouse	: look at item/npc
right mouse	: use item/talk to npc
middle mouse	: feature test button :-) likely to change very often.
		  At the moment it is an object "hurler"
